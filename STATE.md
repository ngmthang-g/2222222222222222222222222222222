## C06 AUDITED / CLOSED RESULTS
- Rechecked the exact user-provided `TLMTool_2.1.2(3).zip`: SHA-256 matches the Gate-A frozen archive, so no forensic baseline was redone.
- Inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` hash matches the binary used by C01–C05.
- Current Xếp-lưới screenshot is byte-identical to the prior Gate-B baseline; UI baseline therefore remains valid.
- Recovered grid config from original binary:
  - `grid_cols` default = 3
  - `grid_rows` default = 4
  - persisted under Start settings.
- `_arrange_grid` recovered with:
  - `GetSystemMetrics`
  - exact literals 450 and 40
  - `min`, `sorted`, `new_slots`, `ww`, `wh`
  - master index 0 / top-left
  - remaining HWNDs sequential after master.
- Exact grid arithmetic formula remains explicit UNKNOWN; no meaning is invented for literals 450/40.
- `_move_windows_offset` is the shared move-only primitive:
  - `pos_fn(index) -> (x,y)`
  - keeps current size
  - master index 0.
- `SetWindowPos` family is recovered; no `MoveWindow` literal/import was recovered from the inner EXE.
- `resize_window` block contains:
  - `GetWindowPlacement`
  - `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`
  - `SetWindowPos`
  - `SWP_NOZORDER`, `SWP_NOACTIVATE`, `SWP_NOMOVE`.
- Shared stack primitives recovered:
  - tight → (0,0)
  - diagonal → +50 x/+50 y
  - horizontal → +50 x
  - vertical → +50 y.
- Layout sync architecture recovered:
  - `_toggle_layout`
  - `_sync_windows_loop`
  - `_layout_worker`
  - `_arrange_grid`
  - cached HWND list via worker.
- Limit model recovered:
  - server source `new_version_info.max_windows`
  - fallback literal 999
  - worker-cached process count
  - over limit prevents sync
  - `_auto_stop_sync` stops both layout sync and input sync.
- Re-audit confirmed the earlier C06 evidence with no contradictions.
- Exact 1.5s cadence recovered in the same binary belongs to input-sync keepalive, NOT layout-worker cadence.
- Explicit unknowns preserved:
  - exact grid arithmetic / final tile-size expression
  - exact grid +/- bounds
  - exact max-window comparator operator
  - exact layout-worker cadence.
- C07 evidence was observed (Auto 1366x768 reset, RoleName auto-tile, 1-second loop) but deliberately not marked complete.

## CURRENT_TASK
C09 — preview columns 1x–5x.

## C07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Auto is the default Start mode (mode_var = auto).
- _on_mode_change is the shared mode switch handler.
- Auto/manual disables both layout sync and input sync.
- Auto transition resets game windows to (0,0) 1366×768 before/around the Auto tile cycle.
- Auto tiling uses _auto_tile_windows + _auto_tile_loop.
- Original EXE documents a 1-second re-arrangement cadence while auto_tile_active=True.
- Auto tiling sorts using character-info RoleName and keeps master first.
- Auto tile toggle is wired to _get_max_windows / _count_game_processes.
- Switching to sync/Xếp-lưới stops active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ.
- Exact final Auto tile arithmetic and exact max-limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- docs/window/C07_AUTO_FLOW.md

## C08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp lưới is internal mode value sync and uses _on_mode_change.
- Entering sync automatically enables layout synchronization and mouse/keyboard synchronization.
- Active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ are stopped before entering sync.
- Grid defaults are 3 columns × 4 rows and match the screenshot.
- Dedicated +/- handlers exist for columns and rows; _on_grid_change updates labels and persists config.
- Layout path uses _sync_windows_loop / _layout_worker / worker cache / _arrange_grid with master first.
- Input sync keepalive is explicitly 1.5 seconds.
- Over-limit path disables both layout and input sync.
- Exact grid bounds, layout-worker cadence, grid arithmetic and limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## BLOCKERS
None known for C09.

## DO_NOT_TOUCH
- Preserve Gate A forensic baseline unchanged.
- Preserve Gate B visual contract unchanged.
- Preserve C01–C06 explicit unknowns.
- Do not invent the exact C06 grid formula from constants 450/40.
- Do not treat C07 cross-task evidence as full C07 verification until C07 is executed.
- Do not begin C08 before C07 is verified.

## NEXT_ACTION
On CONTINUE / current continuation:
1. Read PLAN.md.
2. Read STATE.md.
3. Execute C09 only.
4. Recover the 1x–5x preview-column behavior from the original EXE.
5. Verify manual preview grid state, automatic/manual interaction, preview geometry/rebuild behavior, detached-preview interaction and persistence if any.
6. Use screenshot geometry only as corroboration.
7. Update WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md and persist C09 evidence/report.
8. Advance to C10 only after C09 is verified.
