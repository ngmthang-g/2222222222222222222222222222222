## C06 AUDITED / CLOSED RESULTS
- Rechecked the exact user-provided `TLMTool_2.1.2(3).zip`: SHA-256 matches the Gate-A frozen archive, so no forensic baseline was redone.
- Inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` hash matches the binary used by C01–C05.
- Current Xếp-lưới screenshot is byte-identical to the prior Gate-B baseline; UI baseline therefore remains valid.
- Recovered grid config from original binary:
  - `grid_cols` default = 3
  - `grid_rows` default = 4
  - persisted under Start settings.
- `_arrange_grid` recovered with:
  - `GetSystemMetrics`
  - exact literals 450 and 40
  - `min`, `sorted`, `new_slots`, `ww`, `wh`
  - master index 0 / top-left
  - remaining HWNDs sequential after master.
- Exact grid arithmetic formula remains explicit UNKNOWN; no meaning is invented for literals 450/40.
- `_move_windows_offset` is the shared move-only primitive:
  - `pos_fn(index) -> (x,y)`
  - keeps current size
  - master index 0.
- `SetWindowPos` family is recovered; no `MoveWindow` literal/import was recovered from the inner EXE.
- `resize_window` block contains:
  - `GetWindowPlacement`
  - `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`
  - `SetWindowPos`
  - `SWP_NOZORDER`, `SWP_NOACTIVATE`, `SWP_NOMOVE`.
- Shared stack primitives recovered:
  - tight → (0,0)
  - diagonal → +50 x/+50 y
  - horizontal → +50 x
  - vertical → +50 y.
- Layout sync architecture recovered:
  - `_toggle_layout`
  - `_sync_windows_loop`
  - `_layout_worker`
  - `_arrange_grid`
  - cached HWND list via worker.
- Limit model recovered:
  - server source `new_version_info.max_windows`
  - fallback literal 999
  - worker-cached process count
  - over limit prevents sync
  - `_auto_stop_sync` stops both layout sync and input sync.
- Re-audit confirmed the earlier C06 evidence with no contradictions.
- Exact 1.5s cadence recovered in the same binary belongs to input-sync keepalive, NOT layout-worker cadence.
- Explicit unknowns preserved:
  - exact grid arithmetic / final tile-size expression
  - exact grid +/- bounds
  - exact max-window comparator operator
  - exact layout-worker cadence.
- C07 evidence was observed (Auto 1366x768 reset, RoleName auto-tile, 1-second loop) but deliberately not marked complete.

## CURRENT_TASK
E08 — shutdown/reload.

## C07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Auto is the default Start mode (mode_var = auto).
- _on_mode_change is the shared mode switch handler.
- Auto/manual disables both layout sync and input sync.
- Auto transition resets game windows to (0,0) 1366×768 before/around the Auto tile cycle.
- Auto tiling uses _auto_tile_windows + _auto_tile_loop.
- Original EXE documents a 1-second re-arrangement cadence while auto_tile_active=True.
- Auto tiling sorts using character-info RoleName and keeps master first.
- Auto tile toggle is wired to _get_max_windows / _count_game_processes.
- Switching to sync/Xếp-lưới stops active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ.
- Exact final Auto tile arithmetic and exact max-limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp lưới is internal mode value sync and uses _on_mode_change.
- Entering sync automatically enables layout synchronization and mouse/keyboard synchronization.
- Active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ are stopped before entering sync.
- Grid defaults are 3 columns × 4 rows and match the screenshot.
- Dedicated +/- handlers exist for columns and rows; _on_grid_change updates labels and persists config.
- Layout path uses _sync_windows_loop / _layout_worker / worker cache / _arrange_grid with master first.
- Input sync keepalive is explicitly 1.5 seconds.
- Over-limit path disables both layout and input sync.
- Exact grid bounds, layout-worker cadence, grid arithmetic and limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C09 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview exposes 1x–5x column choices.
- preview_grid_var default is 2x and matches the screenshot.
- _set_manual_preview_grid is the real manual-grid callback.
- _get_preview_columns parses the x-form selection into preview column count.
- refresh_window_preview_list consumes preview_cols/preview_rows and places items by row/column.
- Current 2x geometry remains 3 items in 2 columns, outer frame 205×137, visible surface 197×110.
- Preview order is separate from column count and is preserved by HWND across rebuild.
- Main preview remains live DWM thumbnails.
- Detached preview uses separate detached_grid state and persists it; no main preview_grid settings key was recovered.
- Exact preview_rows arithmetic/manual-flag timing remain explicit UNKNOWN; other column pixel geometries remain runtime-unverified.

## C10 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp gọn is wired to _stack_tight_cmd.
- Exact original behavior: all current game windows move to (0,0).
- Shared _move_windows_offset preserves current size and processes master first.
- Layout movement resets the hidden/off-screen bookkeeping state.
- Shared movement path is SetWindowPos-family, not a resize-to-default operation.
- Exact interaction if the Auto tile loop is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

## C11 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp chéo is wired to _stack_diagonal_cmd.
- Exact positioning rule is origin (0,0) with +50 X/+50 Y per ordered window index.
- Shared engine preserves current size and processes master first.
- Re-layout clears hidden/off-screen bookkeeping.
- Exact interaction if Auto tiling is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C12 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Ẩn hết is a real hide/show toggle using _windows_hidden.
- Hide moves all game windows to (-2200,-2200) and preserves their current size.
- It deliberately avoids SW_HIDE so Unity keeps rendering and PrintWindow/PostMessage background operation remains usable.
- _saved_window_rects + GetWindowRect bookkeeping exists.
- Toggle changes to Hiện hết after hiding.
- Specific restore log/doc says (0,0), while generic toggle doc says old position; exact saved-rect restore use is preserved as a documentation conflict/UNKNOWN.
- Any visible re-layout can clear the hidden bookkeeping through _reset_hidden_state.

## C13 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Đóng xem belongs to the detached-preview control bar and closes preview/view resources, not game windows.
- _close_detached_preview explicitly distinguishes user_initiated=True for the close button.
- Detached view uses real DWM overlay destination windows.
- Refresh is a separate close+reopen path.
- Hủy tách and Đóng xem are distinct visible actions.
- C16 remains the actual game-window Đóng hết task.
- Exact secondary user-initiated state changes and Hủy tách-vs-Đóng xem embedded restoration remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C14 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Tách rời uses _toggle_detached_preview and a real DWM detached-overlay subsystem.
- Detached region is documented as x=0, y=768 to screen bottom, width screen_width-450.
- Detached overlays have topmost behavior.
- detached_auto_open is persisted with fallback True and uses silent no-window opening.
- detached_grid is persisted with recovered default-like value 3.
- Detached control bar includes Cột/Tên/HP/Lv/Map/refresh/Hủy tách/Đóng xem.
- _detached_update_loop rebuilds on game-list changes independently of Start-tab visibility.
- Exact embedded-preview visibility/restoration sequence remains explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C15 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview has a real `Làm mới` control and a dedicated full-list DWM rebuild method.
- Full rebuild clears old preview items, unregisters DWM thumbnails, destroys destination overlay HWNDs/frames, then recreates live DWM previews from the current game-window/cache set.
- Current 1x–5x preview-column selection is reused during rebuild.
- Manual preview ordering is preserved by HWND across refresh/rebuild.
- `_update_window_previews_loop` can also conditionally rebuild the list when `need_refresh` is true and separately refreshes labels/HP.
- Detached ↺ refresh uses `_refresh_detached_preview`: close then reopen to reload the current game-window list.
- Exact Tk command expression for `btn_refresh_preview`, exact `need_refresh` formula, and forced fresh-memory-read semantics remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C16 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview `Đóng hết` is wired to the original close-all callback and shared game-close utility.
- The original utility operates on the current game-window HWND list and sends each live game window a normal Windows close request.
- No force-termination path for the main game executable was recovered in the shared close utility.
- Lingering Unity crash-handler processes are handled by a separate cleanup path.
- This is distinct from `Đóng xem` (preview teardown) and `Làm mới` (preview rebuild).
- Existing discovery/preview maintenance eventually removes stale preview/master state after HWNDs disappear.
- Exact immediate post-click refresh timing remains explicit UNKNOWN; close-specific confirmation behavior was not recovered.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C17 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview arrows reorder the embedded preview list.
- Left uses delta -1; right uses delta +1.
- Order state is keyed by source HWND and survives refresh/rebuild.
- Boundary behavior and detached-order propagation remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C18 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ các cửa sổ` is a real toggle backed by `_toggle_layout`.
- Runtime state includes `layout_active`, `sync_layout_running`, `sync_loop_id`, and grid-slot state.
- The maintenance path uses `_sync_windows_loop` → `_layout_worker` → worker-cached HWNDs → `_arrange_grid`.
- Grid application is master-aware: current master is index 0/top-left.
- Xếp-lưới mode auto-enables layout synchronization; Auto/manual disables it.
- Runtime max-window policy is integrated; the over-limit path stops both synchronization subsystems.
- Manual master change auto-disabling layout sync is not proven.
- Exact worker cadence, initial layout-active value, and exact stop/cancel ordering remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C19 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ phím chuột` is a real persistent input-synchronization subsystem.
- The selected master window is the event source; other game windows are targets.
- Mouse coordinates are converted to master-client coordinates and scaled to each target client size.
- Click processing is ordered; scroll and mouse-move have dedicated paths, with move throttling.
- Input-sync keepalive is exactly 1.5 seconds.
- Stale target state is released by a watchdog at about 10 seconds.
- Changing master while input sync is active turns input sync off and releases target state.
- Keyboard press/release uses a dedicated synchronization path.
- Exact key-message format, move-throttle interval, listener startup timing and retry delay remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C20 VERIFIED RESULTS
- The locked original screenshot shows three simultaneously tracked game identities: 75C.S6, TổngTài.S6, ThápCa.
- TổngTài.S6 is selected as master while the preview order starts with 75C.S6, proving master order and preview order are independent.
- Embedded preview uses 2 columns while physical game-window layout independently uses a 3×4 grid setting.
- With three live HWNDs, the combined model is one master source plus two follower targets.
- C01–C19 discovery, identity, DWM preview, ordering, layout, refresh, close, layout-sync and input-sync models are mutually coherent.
- Exact physical grid geometry/timing and a future reconstructed-build Windows three-HWND parity run remain deferred rather than falsely marked PASS.

## GATE C DECISION
- C01–C20 analysis is complete for original static + screenshot evidence.
- Remaining unknowns are explicit and localized.
- Reconstructed executable runtime parity is deferred to the later implementation/parity stage.

## D01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Frozen inner EXE hash rechecked against Gate A.
- 244 valid exact module markers were recovered from the original EXE.
- 538 unique module-like `.py` filename references were recovered as supplemental provenance.
- 32 physical native `.pyd` modules were inventoried from the frozen distribution.
- Canonical D01 inventory contains 573 rows: 570 accepted unique names + 3 rejected string artifacts.
- Accepted categories: 42 TLM internal, 225 third-party Python, 265 stdlib references, 32 native extensions, 6 Nuitka hooks.
- Confidence is explicit: 276 HIGH, 294 MEDIUM; filename-only references are not overclaimed as executed modules.
- The full row-level inventory is committed as `D01_MODULE_INVENTORY.tsv.gz`; helper EXEs/DLLs/resources are inventoried separately.

## D02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- 37 TLM internal modules with exact compiled module markers were eligible as relationship sources.
- 5 filename-only TLM names remain targets-only for this extraction method: TLMTool, bag_filter, emu_reader, pixel, proxy_refresh.
- 377 deduplicated static module-reference edges were recovered from compiled module blocks.
- Target categories: 132 TLM internal, 59 third-party Python, 153 stdlib references, 33 native-extension references.
- The 132 internal→internal edges span 31 sources and 36 distinct internal targets.
- `info_tab` and `utils` are the strongest internal reference hubs in this graph.
- Every edge is explicitly labeled `STATIC_REFERENCE_NOT_IMPORT_PROOF`; exact Python import syntax/order is not fabricated.
- The internal graph is persisted compressed; the full 377-row evidence table is reproducible with the committed extractor.

## C15–C20 + D01 AUDIT
- Exact user archive and inner EXE hashes rechecked against Gate A.
- C15/C16 semantics remain correct; evidence tables had several nearby/off-by-one offsets and were normalized to exact literal/symbol starts.
- C17/C18 semantic models remain correct with their existing explicit unknowns.
- C19 model status metadata was aligned with the detailed task status.
- C20 wording was tightened to static+visual original evidence; no new live runtime trace is claimed.
- D01 reproducibility was corrected: raw source-filename candidates = 541; normalized count = 538 after collapsing three exact leading-u duplicate-tag pairs.
- Canonical D01 accepted inventory remains 570 names; D02 is unaffected.
- Audit report: docs/tasks/C15_C20_D01_AUDIT.md

## D03 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Third-party presence, exact version evidence and direct TLM reference evidence are separated.
- Exact package versions recovered for requests 2.34.2, urllib3 2.7.0, Pillow 12.3.0, cryptography 49.0.0, idna 3.18, certifi 2026.06.17, PyAutoGUI 0.9.54, pyperclip 1.11.0, PyScreeze 1.0.1, PyTweening 1.2.0, PyMsgBox 1.0.9, PyGetWindow 0.0.9 and six 1.17.0.
- PyWin32 binaries expose File/ProductVersion 3.10.312.0.
- 32 PYD files split into 16 CPython/runtime extensions and 16 third-party native extensions.
- Direct internal reference mapping identifies major Windows/input/process families without overclaiming exact Python import syntax.
- Frida/psutil/pynput/keyboard/mouse/typing_extensions/Brotli/cffi package versions remain UNKNOWN where no strong version evidence was recovered.

## D04 VERIFIED RESULTS
- D02 132-edge internal reference graph was reproduced and preserved as Tier-B static-reference evidence.
- Stronger Tier-A contextual edges were separated from simple compiled-name adjacency.
- Key contextual relationships include Start→Daily/Farm coordination, FarmData→Start/DLL injector, MemoryItems→MemoryReader/DLL injector, FastTravel→Forwarder, and emulator input→remote/farm/train/permission integration.
- Three contextual relationships stronger than the original D02 exact-name edge set are recorded separately rather than silently mutating D02.
- Internal modules were grouped into shell/orchestration, feature automation, low-level game integration, guard/metadata/support, and emulator layers.
- Five filename-only internal names remain unable to provide reliable outgoing exact-marker blocks: TLMTool, bag_filter, emu_reader, pixel, proxy_refresh.
- Exact original Python import syntax remains UNKNOWN.

## D05 VERIFIED RESULTS
- 37 exact-marker TLM compiled-module blocks were mapped from the frozen inner EXE.
- 273,502 raw printable strings fall inside those block intervals; a reproducible classifier selects 38,901 high-signal rows.
- High-signal categories include WinAPI/constants, logs/UI text, paths/files, URLs and meaningful symbols.
- Exact offsets and per-module counts are persisted; representative samples are committed.
- The unusually large info_tab marker interval is explicitly treated as compiled-block provenance, not literal source-file ownership.
- Five filename-only internal names remain unassigned because this method requires exact module markers.
- Full raw/high-signal tables can be reproduced by the committed extractor; original Python source-line ownership is not claimed.

## D06 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Gate-A package DATA set was reconciled: 23 DATA files plus Default.ppx as an additional config resource.
- Fourteen high-entropy MZ/PE-like invalid .dat files remain opaque; semantic roles are not inferred from filenames.
- Active data/resources.dat is a valid x64 PE DLL-format injected payload; five old/backup copies are preserved separately.
- version.dat is a valid x64 version.dll-compatible proxy PE with Version API exports.
- automove_log.txt and proxy_working.txt are plain-text runtime data/log files with direct consumers.
- Default.ppx is the Proxifier XML template using local SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:10800 for the game rule.
- Persistent PC settings/config, login JSON state, forwarder/proxy coordination files, Android guest JSON, and logs are separated by lifecycle.
- emu_client.js and ld_remote.js are explicitly deferred to D07.

## D07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- emu_client.js is a 150-line Frida 17 resident RPC memory reader with 7 exported RPC methods.
- Player structure offsets/validation and bag Site==10 counting were recovered directly from the shipped JS.
- ld_remote.js is a 1297-line AutoX/Auto.js floating guest UI and HTTP client.
- PC listener contract includes 0.0.0.0, default port 8765, default token tlm, emulator identification by peer IPv4, maps/status/config/coords/action endpoints.
- Overlay uses local AutoX storage plus /sdcard/TLM/tlm_<aid8>.json as an ADB-readable bridge.
- forwarder.exe is a separate Nuitka SOCKS4/SOCKS5/HTTP CONNECT proxy helper with its own runtime state files.
- bootstrap/update/7z/Proxifier helper connections were recorded without reopening Gate-A scope.
- No helper, Frida script, emulator script or injected payload was executed during D07; live runtime parity remains deferred.

## D08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- D01–D07 were reconciled into one integrated architecture handoff.
- Main architecture is separated into shell/orchestration, feature automation, shared support/guards, low-level PC game integration, emulator path, proxy helpers, update helpers and persistent data stores.
- Diagram edge meanings explicitly separate contextual Tier-A evidence, static Tier-B references, protocol/helper boundaries and data associations.
- Key parity constraints are preserved: master vs preview order, physical vs preview grids, layout vs input sync, PC vs emulator paths, runtime config vs immutable payload, static reference vs exact import syntax.
- Gate D is complete for static architecture evidence; live helper/emulator/runtime parity remains deferred.

## GATE D DECISION
- D01–D08 COMPLETE / VERIFIED for static architecture evidence.
- Remaining uncertainty is explicit and moves to later implementation/runtime gates.

## E01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main shell class is TLMMainApp with a normal GUI lifecycle plus a special --forwarder branch.
- Startup diagnostics include debug logger, faulthandler crash logging and a custom threading exception hook.
- A Windows named mutex TLMTool_SingleInstance enforces single-instance behavior.
- Tk root, TLMMainApp, splash close contract and mainloop are all recovered; exact micro-order of app/splash construction remains explicit UNKNOWN.
- TLMMainApp constructs the potential tab set, starts CPU monitoring, binds NotebookTabChanged and installs permission/plan/limit lifecycle hooks.
- TLMInfoTab participates in startup service behavior: startup server call, plan/license/permission update and heartbeat.
- Selected-tab refresh loops are coordinated centrally.
- Normal cleanup is driven through Tk/widget Destroy handlers; exact cross-tab destroy order remains UNKNOWN.
- Heartbeat-enforced forced quit destroys the GUI then uses os._exit to terminate despite non-daemon workers; that path intentionally leaves forwarder child process running.

## E02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Root title is `TLMTool`; `250x20` is a transient startup geometry, not the final production size.
- Root startup attributes include `-topmost=True`, frozen `_MEIPASS` icon resolution for `icon.ico`, and `withdraw` during construction.
- Root/global default font is statically recovered as the exact tuple `("Segoe UI", 9)` applied via `option_add("*Font", ...)`.
- This corrects the earlier broad B13 font-size UNKNOWN: root/global size 9 is now verified; explicit per-widget overrides remain unknown where not separately evidenced.
- ttk.Notebook is packed with fill/expand behavior and exact 5 px outer packing margin; Gate-B raster geometry corroborates the 5 px margin.
- `TNotebook.Tab` padding and `TNotebook` tabmargins are configured, but exact source list values remain explicit UNKNOWN.
- `position_window_top_right` uses screen width/height plus exact literals 80, 450 and 10; high-confidence model is w=450, h=screen_height-80, x=max(0,screen_width-w-10), y=0.
- The exact arithmetic source expression remains not directly recovered; the production screenshot target remains 450×1000 client pixels.
- Literal `350x450+1621+0` is quarantined as stale/example/unknown-flow and is not allowed to override 12/12 screenshot evidence.
- No explicit resizable/minsize/maxsize policy was recovered in the main-shell block.

## E03 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `create_tabs` uses local `_new_tab` plus `_tab_inner`, `_tab_frames`, `_tab_keys` maps.
- Potential insertion order contains Start/Login/Party/Train/Train LSV/Train LD/Phó Bản/Daily/Đồn/Rao/Tối ưu/Info/Proxy/Debug/Debug Android.
- Gate-B visible production order is the same sequence with Train LD, Proxy, Debug and Debug Android hidden.
- Info is the invariant always-visible fallback; if selected tab becomes hidden, selection moves to Info.
- Debug/Android/Proxy are dev-gated; Đồn/Rao/Tối ưu are permission-controlled.
- Tab content has a one-time lazy-build guard plus `_rebuild_tab` path.
- `_make_scrollable` provides Canvas+vertical Scrollbar+MouseWheel wrapper.
- Central refresh lifecycle stops old tab polling and starts selected tab polling; after build only selected refresh-capable tab polls.
- Permission/account-limit changes can disable child controls without destroying tab content.

## E04 AUDIT / COMPLETION
- Existing E04 report and state table were audited against prior Gate-D/E01-E03 evidence.
- No semantic contradiction was found; the ownership model is coherent.
- The declared JSON model artifact was missing and has now been created.

## E04 VERIFIED RESULTS
- TLMMainApp owns shell coordination state and tab instance refs.
- permission_guard owns normalized permission/plan/limit decisions and the block-notifier service API.
- TLMInfoTab owns server/license/session/heartbeat transport state.
- TLMStartTab owns multi-window HWND/preview/grid/sync runtime state.
- Feature FSM/account/schedule state remains tab-owned.
- Cross-thread block notifications marshal back to Tk with root.after.
- Persistent files remain separate from in-memory app state.
- Exact private permission_guard backing globals and heartbeat mutation order remain explicit UNKNOWN/PARTIAL.

## E05 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Shared config service exposes CONFIG_PATH/CONFIG_DIR/SETTINGS_PATH plus get/load/save/read/write helpers.
- Shared central config path is %APPDATA%/TLMTool/config.ini using RawConfigParser and UTF-8 section/key writes.
- settings.ini safe-read behavior explicitly tolerates duplicate keys with last-wins/no-error semantics.
- settings.ini writes use temp file + os.replace atomic replacement and dated backup/pruning behavior.
- _BACKUP_KEEP exists but its exact numeric value remains UNKNOWN.
- _settings_lock is shared across config-consuming tabs; exact lock class remains UNKNOWN.
- Feature tabs share the [Settings] section but own typed defaults/fallbacks and JSON-in-INI complex values.
- InfoTab has a separate config.ini simple-dict ConfigParser contract and is not silently merged with the central APPDATA config helper.
- Runtime JSON/text state files remain separate from the shared INI service.
- No global filesystem hot-reload watcher was recovered.

## E06 VERIFIED RESULTS
- debug_logger.setup creates the central append-only session log under log/tlmtool.log and tees stdout/stderr to the original streams plus the file.
- Session Start/End markers, runtime/executable information and timestamp formatting are recovered.
- Central log trimming drops oldest content when MAX_SIZE is exceeded and keeps newest KEEP_SIZE content; exact numeric size values remain UNKNOWN.
- Main startup separately enables faulthandler against crash_fault.log.
- A custom threading.excepthook records [THREAD-EXC] metadata plus traceback through the central log path.
- memory diagnostics use separate tlm_memory.log with documented >1MB truncation behavior.
- data/automove_log.txt is monitored by Tối ưu watchdog for per-PID Perf: ping evidence and belongs to the injected/performance diagnostic boundary.
- No explicit central logging lock/queue was recovered; concurrent-write serialization remains NOT RECOVERED.

## E07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Concurrency is split across Tk after/after_cancel jobs, Python worker threads, listener/service threads, and external/native process boundaries.
- Background workers return Tk mutations through root.after rather than touching widgets directly.
- CPU monitor is a daemon worker with bounded join cleanup.
- Start input sync uses a Queue-backed serialized worker plus Locks and daemon listener threads.
- Start preview/cache worker performs window/basic-info refresh around 3s and heavier memory refresh around 8s without Tk calls.
- Login owns cancellation Events and a launch Lock; Party owns cancellation/locks and one-thread-per-group execution with join(timeout).
- Daily/Farm/Train families use per-account threads, stop Events/running-generation flags and main-thread UI apply.
- Emulator remote listener is a daemon ThreadingHTTPServer service with shutdown/server_close.
- Info heartbeat is centrally coordinated through Tk after-id state.
- CreateRemoteThread/helper processes are explicitly separated from Python threading.
- Exact daemon flag for every worker, every join timeout, and simultaneous global stop ordering remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## BLOCKERS
None known for E08.

## DO_NOT_TOUCH
- Preserve Gate A forensic baseline unchanged.
- Preserve Gate B visual contract unchanged.
- Preserve C01–C06 explicit unknowns.
- Do not invent the exact C06 grid formula from constants 450/40.
- Do not treat C07 cross-task evidence as full C07 verification until C07 is executed.
- Do not begin C08 before C07 is verified.

## NEXT_ACTION
On CONTINUE / current continuation:
1. Read PLAN.md.
2. Read STATE.md.
3. Execute E08 only.
4. Recover shutdown/reload behavior: normal widget destruction, per-tab stop/save hooks, root destruction, forced heartbeat exit, refresh/rebuild/reload workers, updater relaunch, and helper-process survival/cleanup boundaries.
5. Separate in-app tab reload/rebuild from full process restart/update.
6. Persist E08 evidence/report and advance to E09 only after verification.
