## C06 AUDITED / CLOSED RESULTS
- Rechecked the exact user-provided `TLMTool_2.1.2(3).zip`: SHA-256 matches the Gate-A frozen archive, so no forensic baseline was redone.
- Inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` hash matches the binary used by C01–C05.
- Current Xếp-lưới screenshot is byte-identical to the prior Gate-B baseline; UI baseline therefore remains valid.
- Recovered grid config from original binary:
  - `grid_cols` default = 3
  - `grid_rows` default = 4
  - persisted under Start settings.
- `_arrange_grid` recovered with:
  - `GetSystemMetrics`
  - exact literals 450 and 40
  - `min`, `sorted`, `new_slots`, `ww`, `wh`
  - master index 0 / top-left
  - remaining HWNDs sequential after master.
- Exact grid arithmetic formula remains explicit UNKNOWN; no meaning is invented for literals 450/40.
- `_move_windows_offset` is the shared move-only primitive:
  - `pos_fn(index) -> (x,y)`
  - keeps current size
  - master index 0.
- `SetWindowPos` family is recovered; no `MoveWindow` literal/import was recovered from the inner EXE.
- `resize_window` block contains:
  - `GetWindowPlacement`
  - `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`
  - `SetWindowPos`
  - `SWP_NOZORDER`, `SWP_NOACTIVATE`, `SWP_NOMOVE`.
- Shared stack primitives recovered:
  - tight → (0,0)
  - diagonal → +50 x/+50 y
  - horizontal → +50 x
  - vertical → +50 y.
- Layout sync architecture recovered:
  - `_toggle_layout`
  - `_sync_windows_loop`
  - `_layout_worker`
  - `_arrange_grid`
  - cached HWND list via worker.
- Limit model recovered:
  - server source `new_version_info.max_windows`
  - fallback literal 999
  - worker-cached process count
  - over limit prevents sync
  - `_auto_stop_sync` stops both layout sync and input sync.
- Re-audit confirmed the earlier C06 evidence with no contradictions.
- Exact 1.5s cadence recovered in the same binary belongs to input-sync keepalive, NOT layout-worker cadence.
- Explicit unknowns preserved:
  - exact grid arithmetic / final tile-size expression
  - exact grid +/- bounds
  - exact max-window comparator operator
  - exact layout-worker cadence.
- C07 evidence was observed (Auto 1366x768 reset, RoleName auto-tile, 1-second loop) but deliberately not marked complete.

## CURRENT_TASK
G03 — Party character-state model.

## C07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Auto is the default Start mode (mode_var = auto).
- _on_mode_change is the shared mode switch handler.
- Auto/manual disables both layout sync and input sync.
- Auto transition resets game windows to (0,0) 1366×768 before/around the Auto tile cycle.
- Auto tiling uses _auto_tile_windows + _auto_tile_loop.
- Original EXE documents a 1-second re-arrangement cadence while auto_tile_active=True.
- Auto tiling sorts using character-info RoleName and keeps master first.
- Auto tile toggle is wired to _get_max_windows / _count_game_processes.
- Switching to sync/Xếp-lưới stops active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ.
- Exact final Auto tile arithmetic and exact max-limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp lưới is internal mode value sync and uses _on_mode_change.
- Entering sync automatically enables layout synchronization and mouse/keyboard synchronization.
- Active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ are stopped before entering sync.
- Grid defaults are 3 columns × 4 rows and match the screenshot.
- Dedicated +/- handlers exist for columns and rows; _on_grid_change updates labels and persists config.
- Layout path uses _sync_windows_loop / _layout_worker / worker cache / _arrange_grid with master first.
- Input sync keepalive is explicitly 1.5 seconds.
- Over-limit path disables both layout and input sync.
- Exact grid bounds, layout-worker cadence, grid arithmetic and limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C09 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview exposes 1x–5x column choices.
- preview_grid_var default is 2x and matches the screenshot.
- _set_manual_preview_grid is the real manual-grid callback.
- _get_preview_columns parses the x-form selection into preview column count.
- refresh_window_preview_list consumes preview_cols/preview_rows and places items by row/column.
- Current 2x geometry remains 3 items in 2 columns, outer frame 205×137, visible surface 197×110.
- Preview order is separate from column count and is preserved by HWND across rebuild.
- Main preview remains live DWM thumbnails.
- Detached preview uses separate detached_grid state and persists it; no main preview_grid settings key was recovered.
- Exact preview_rows arithmetic/manual-flag timing remain explicit UNKNOWN; other column pixel geometries remain runtime-unverified.

## C10 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp gọn is wired to _stack_tight_cmd.
- Exact original behavior: all current game windows move to (0,0).
- Shared _move_windows_offset preserves current size and processes master first.
- Layout movement resets the hidden/off-screen bookkeeping state.
- Shared movement path is SetWindowPos-family, not a resize-to-default operation.
- Exact interaction if the Auto tile loop is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

## C11 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp chéo is wired to _stack_diagonal_cmd.
- Exact positioning rule is origin (0,0) with +50 X/+50 Y per ordered window index.
- Shared engine preserves current size and processes master first.
- Re-layout clears hidden/off-screen bookkeeping.
- Exact interaction if Auto tiling is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C12 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Ẩn hết is a real hide/show toggle using _windows_hidden.
- Hide moves all game windows to (-2200,-2200) and preserves their current size.
- It deliberately avoids SW_HIDE so Unity keeps rendering and PrintWindow/PostMessage background operation remains usable.
- _saved_window_rects + GetWindowRect bookkeeping exists.
- Toggle changes to Hiện hết after hiding.
- Specific restore log/doc says (0,0), while generic toggle doc says old position; exact saved-rect restore use is preserved as a documentation conflict/UNKNOWN.
- Any visible re-layout can clear the hidden bookkeeping through _reset_hidden_state.

## C13 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Đóng xem belongs to the detached-preview control bar and closes preview/view resources, not game windows.
- _close_detached_preview explicitly distinguishes user_initiated=True for the close button.
- Detached view uses real DWM overlay destination windows.
- Refresh is a separate close+reopen path.
- Hủy tách and Đóng xem are distinct visible actions.
- C16 remains the actual game-window Đóng hết task.
- Exact secondary user-initiated state changes and Hủy tách-vs-Đóng xem embedded restoration remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C14 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Tách rời uses _toggle_detached_preview and a real DWM detached-overlay subsystem.
- Detached region is documented as x=0, y=768 to screen bottom, width screen_width-450.
- Detached overlays have topmost behavior.
- detached_auto_open is persisted with fallback True and uses silent no-window opening.
- detached_grid is persisted with recovered default-like value 3.
- Detached control bar includes Cột/Tên/HP/Lv/Map/refresh/Hủy tách/Đóng xem.
- _detached_update_loop rebuilds on game-list changes independently of Start-tab visibility.
- Exact embedded-preview visibility/restoration sequence remains explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C15 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview has a real `Làm mới` control and a dedicated full-list DWM rebuild method.
- Full rebuild clears old preview items, unregisters DWM thumbnails, destroys destination overlay HWNDs/frames, then recreates live DWM previews from the current game-window/cache set.
- Current 1x–5x preview-column selection is reused during rebuild.
- Manual preview ordering is preserved by HWND across refresh/rebuild.
- `_update_window_previews_loop` can also conditionally rebuild the list when `need_refresh` is true and separately refreshes labels/HP.
- Detached ↺ refresh uses `_refresh_detached_preview`: close then reopen to reload the current game-window list.
- Exact Tk command expression for `btn_refresh_preview`, exact `need_refresh` formula, and forced fresh-memory-read semantics remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C16 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview `Đóng hết` is wired to the original close-all callback and shared game-close utility.
- The original utility operates on the current game-window HWND list and sends each live game window a normal Windows close request.
- No force-termination path for the main game executable was recovered in the shared close utility.
- Lingering Unity crash-handler processes are handled by a separate cleanup path.
- This is distinct from `Đóng xem` (preview teardown) and `Làm mới` (preview rebuild).
- Existing discovery/preview maintenance eventually removes stale preview/master state after HWNDs disappear.
- Exact immediate post-click refresh timing remains explicit UNKNOWN; close-specific confirmation behavior was not recovered.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C17 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview arrows reorder the embedded preview list.
- Left uses delta -1; right uses delta +1.
- Order state is keyed by source HWND and survives refresh/rebuild.
- Boundary behavior and detached-order propagation remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C18 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ các cửa sổ` is a real toggle backed by `_toggle_layout`.
- Runtime state includes `layout_active`, `sync_layout_running`, `sync_loop_id`, and grid-slot state.
- The maintenance path uses `_sync_windows_loop` → `_layout_worker` → worker-cached HWNDs → `_arrange_grid`.
- Grid application is master-aware: current master is index 0/top-left.
- Xếp-lưới mode auto-enables layout synchronization; Auto/manual disables it.
- Runtime max-window policy is integrated; the over-limit path stops both synchronization subsystems.
- Manual master change auto-disabling layout sync is not proven.
- Exact worker cadence, initial layout-active value, and exact stop/cancel ordering remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C19 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ phím chuột` is a real persistent input-synchronization subsystem.
- The selected master window is the event source; other game windows are targets.
- Mouse coordinates are converted to master-client coordinates and scaled to each target client size.
- Click processing is ordered; scroll and mouse-move have dedicated paths, with move throttling.
- Input-sync keepalive is exactly 1.5 seconds.
- Stale target state is released by a watchdog at about 10 seconds.
- Changing master while input sync is active turns input sync off and releases target state.
- Keyboard press/release uses a dedicated synchronization path.
- Exact key-message format, move-throttle interval, listener startup timing and retry delay remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C20 VERIFIED RESULTS
- The locked original screenshot shows three simultaneously tracked game identities: 75C.S6, TổngTài.S6, ThápCa.
- TổngTài.S6 is selected as master while the preview order starts with 75C.S6, proving master order and preview order are independent.
- Embedded preview uses 2 columns while physical game-window layout independently uses a 3×4 grid setting.
- With three live HWNDs, the combined model is one master source plus two follower targets.
- C01–C19 discovery, identity, DWM preview, ordering, layout, refresh, close, layout-sync and input-sync models are mutually coherent.
- Exact physical grid geometry/timing and a future reconstructed-build Windows three-HWND parity run remain deferred rather than falsely marked PASS.

## GATE C DECISION
- C01–C20 analysis is complete for original static + screenshot evidence.
- Remaining unknowns are explicit and localized.
- Reconstructed executable runtime parity is deferred to the later implementation/parity stage.

## D01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Frozen inner EXE hash rechecked against Gate A.
- 244 valid exact module markers were recovered from the original EXE.
- 538 unique module-like `.py` filename references were recovered as supplemental provenance.
- 32 physical native `.pyd` modules were inventoried from the frozen distribution.
- Canonical D01 inventory contains 573 rows: 570 accepted unique names + 3 rejected string artifacts.
- Accepted categories: 42 TLM internal, 225 third-party Python, 265 stdlib references, 32 native extensions, 6 Nuitka hooks.
- Confidence is explicit: 276 HIGH, 294 MEDIUM; filename-only references are not overclaimed as executed modules.
- The full row-level inventory is committed as `D01_MODULE_INVENTORY.tsv.gz`; helper EXEs/DLLs/resources are inventoried separately.

## D02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- 37 TLM internal modules with exact compiled module markers were eligible as relationship sources.
- 5 filename-only TLM names remain targets-only for this extraction method: TLMTool, bag_filter, emu_reader, pixel, proxy_refresh.
- 377 deduplicated static module-reference edges were recovered from compiled module blocks.
- Target categories: 132 TLM internal, 59 third-party Python, 153 stdlib references, 33 native-extension references.
- The 132 internal→internal edges span 31 sources and 36 distinct internal targets.
- `info_tab` and `utils` are the strongest internal reference hubs in this graph.
- Every edge is explicitly labeled `STATIC_REFERENCE_NOT_IMPORT_PROOF`; exact Python import syntax/order is not fabricated.
- The internal graph is persisted compressed; the full 377-row evidence table is reproducible with the committed extractor.

## C15–C20 + D01 AUDIT
- Exact user archive and inner EXE hashes rechecked against Gate A.
- C15/C16 semantics remain correct; evidence tables had several nearby/off-by-one offsets and were normalized to exact literal/symbol starts.
- C17/C18 semantic models remain correct with their existing explicit unknowns.
- C19 model status metadata was aligned with the detailed task status.
- C20 wording was tightened to static+visual original evidence; no new live runtime trace is claimed.
- D01 reproducibility was corrected: raw source-filename candidates = 541; normalized count = 538 after collapsing three exact leading-u duplicate-tag pairs.
- Canonical D01 accepted inventory remains 570 names; D02 is unaffected.
- Audit report: docs/tasks/C15_C20_D01_AUDIT.md

## D03 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Third-party presence, exact version evidence and direct TLM reference evidence are separated.
- Exact package versions recovered for requests 2.34.2, urllib3 2.7.0, Pillow 12.3.0, cryptography 49.0.0, idna 3.18, certifi 2026.06.17, PyAutoGUI 0.9.54, pyperclip 1.11.0, PyScreeze 1.0.1, PyTweening 1.2.0, PyMsgBox 1.0.9, PyGetWindow 0.0.9 and six 1.17.0.
- PyWin32 binaries expose File/ProductVersion 3.10.312.0.
- 32 PYD files split into 16 CPython/runtime extensions and 16 third-party native extensions.
- Direct internal reference mapping identifies major Windows/input/process families without overclaiming exact Python import syntax.
- Frida/psutil/pynput/keyboard/mouse/typing_extensions/Brotli/cffi package versions remain UNKNOWN where no strong version evidence was recovered.

## D04 VERIFIED RESULTS
- D02 132-edge internal reference graph was reproduced and preserved as Tier-B static-reference evidence.
- Stronger Tier-A contextual edges were separated from simple compiled-name adjacency.
- Key contextual relationships include Start→Daily/Farm coordination, FarmData→Start/DLL injector, MemoryItems→MemoryReader/DLL injector, FastTravel→Forwarder, and emulator input→remote/farm/train/permission integration.
- Three contextual relationships stronger than the original D02 exact-name edge set are recorded separately rather than silently mutating D02.
- Internal modules were grouped into shell/orchestration, feature automation, low-level game integration, guard/metadata/support, and emulator layers.
- Five filename-only internal names remain unable to provide reliable outgoing exact-marker blocks: TLMTool, bag_filter, emu_reader, pixel, proxy_refresh.
- Exact original Python import syntax remains UNKNOWN.

## D05 VERIFIED RESULTS
- 37 exact-marker TLM compiled-module blocks were mapped from the frozen inner EXE.
- 273,502 raw printable strings fall inside those block intervals; a reproducible classifier selects 38,901 high-signal rows.
- High-signal categories include WinAPI/constants, logs/UI text, paths/files, URLs and meaningful symbols.
- Exact offsets and per-module counts are persisted; representative samples are committed.
- The unusually large info_tab marker interval is explicitly treated as compiled-block provenance, not literal source-file ownership.
- Five filename-only internal names remain unassigned because this method requires exact module markers.
- Full raw/high-signal tables can be reproduced by the committed extractor; original Python source-line ownership is not claimed.

## D06 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Gate-A package DATA set was reconciled: 23 DATA files plus Default.ppx as an additional config resource.
- Fourteen high-entropy MZ/PE-like invalid .dat files remain opaque; semantic roles are not inferred from filenames.
- Active data/resources.dat is a valid x64 PE DLL-format injected payload; five old/backup copies are preserved separately.
- version.dat is a valid x64 version.dll-compatible proxy PE with Version API exports.
- automove_log.txt and proxy_working.txt are plain-text runtime data/log files with direct consumers.
- Default.ppx is the Proxifier XML template using local SOCKS5 127.0.0.1:10800 for the game rule.
- Persistent PC settings/config, login JSON state, forwarder/proxy coordination files, Android guest JSON, and logs are separated by lifecycle.
- emu_client.js and ld_remote.js are explicitly deferred to D07.

## D07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- emu_client.js is a 150-line Frida 17 resident RPC memory reader with 7 exported RPC methods.
- Player structure offsets/validation and bag Site==10 counting were recovered directly from the shipped JS.
- ld_remote.js is a 1297-line AutoX/Auto.js floating guest UI and HTTP client.
- PC listener contract includes 0.0.0.0, default port 8765, default token tlm, emulator identification by peer IPv4, maps/status/config/coords/action endpoints.
- Overlay uses local AutoX storage plus /sdcard/TLM/tlm_<aid8>.json as an ADB-readable bridge.
- forwarder.exe is a separate Nuitka SOCKS4/SOCKS5/HTTP CONNECT proxy helper with its own runtime state files.
- bootstrap/update/7z/Proxifier helper connections were recorded without reopening Gate-A scope.
- No helper, Frida script, emulator script or injected payload was executed during D07; live runtime parity remains deferred.

## D08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- D01–D07 were reconciled into one integrated architecture handoff.
- Main architecture is separated into shell/orchestration, feature automation, shared support/guards, low-level PC game integration, emulator path, proxy helpers, update helpers and persistent data stores.
- Diagram edge meanings explicitly separate contextual Tier-A evidence, static Tier-B references, protocol/helper boundaries and data associations.
- Key parity constraints are preserved: master vs preview order, physical vs preview grids, layout vs input sync, PC vs emulator paths, runtime config vs immutable payload, static reference vs exact import syntax.
- Gate D is complete for static architecture evidence; live helper/emulator/runtime parity remains deferred.

## GATE D DECISION
- D01–D08 COMPLETE / VERIFIED for static architecture evidence.
- Remaining uncertainty is explicit and moves to later implementation/runtime gates.

## E01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main shell class is TLMMainApp with a normal GUI lifecycle plus a special --forwarder branch.
- Startup diagnostics include debug logger, faulthandler crash logging and a custom threading exception hook.
- A Windows named mutex TLMTool_SingleInstance enforces single-instance behavior.
- Tk root, TLMMainApp, splash close contract and mainloop are all recovered; exact micro-order of app/splash construction remains explicit UNKNOWN.
- TLMMainApp constructs the potential tab set, starts CPU monitoring, binds NotebookTabChanged and installs permission/plan/limit lifecycle hooks.
- TLMInfoTab participates in startup service behavior: startup server call, plan/license/permission update and heartbeat.
- Selected-tab refresh loops are coordinated centrally.
- Normal cleanup is driven through Tk/widget Destroy handlers; exact cross-tab destroy order remains UNKNOWN.
- Heartbeat-enforced forced quit destroys the GUI then uses os._exit to terminate despite non-daemon workers; that path intentionally leaves forwarder child process running.

## E02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Root title is `TLMTool`; `250x20` is a transient startup geometry, not the final production size.
- Root startup attributes include `-topmost=True`, frozen `_MEIPASS` icon resolution for `icon.ico`, and `withdraw` during construction.
- Root/global default font is statically recovered as the exact tuple `("Segoe UI", 9)` applied via `option_add("*Font", ...)`.
- This corrects the earlier broad B13 font-size UNKNOWN: root/global size 9 is now verified; explicit per-widget overrides remain unknown where not separately evidenced.
- ttk.Notebook is packed with fill/expand behavior and exact 5 px outer packing margin; Gate-B raster geometry corroborates the 5 px margin.
- `TNotebook.Tab` padding and `TNotebook` tabmargins are configured, but exact source list values remain explicit UNKNOWN.
- `position_window_top_right` uses screen width/height plus exact literals 80, 450 and 10; high-confidence model is w=450, h=screen_height-80, x=max(0,screen_width-w-10), y=0.
- The exact arithmetic source expression remains not directly recovered; the production screenshot target remains 450×1000 client pixels.
- Literal `350x450+1621+0` is quarantined as stale/example/unknown-flow and is not allowed to override 12/12 screenshot evidence.
- No explicit resizable/minsize/maxsize policy was recovered in the main-shell block.

- `create_tabs` uses local `_new_tab` plus `_tab_inner`, `_tab_frames`, `_tab_keys` maps.
- Potential insertion order contains Start/Login/Party/Train/Train LSV/Train LD/Phó Bản/Daily/Đồn/Rao/Tối ưu/Info/Proxy/Debug/Debug Android.
- Gate-B visible production order is the same sequence with Train LD, Proxy, Debug and Debug Android hidden.
- Info is the invariant always-visible fallback; if selected tab becomes hidden, selection moves to Info.
- Debug/Android/Proxy are dev-gated; Đồn/Rao/Tối ưu are permission-controlled.
- Tab content has a one-time lazy-build guard plus `_rebuild_tab` path.
- `_make_scrollable` provides Canvas+vertical Scrollbar+MouseWheel wrapper.
- Central refresh lifecycle stops old tab polling and starts selected tab polling; after build only selected refresh-capable tab polls.
- Permission/account-limit changes can disable child controls without destroying tab content.

## E04 AUDIT / COMPLETION
- Existing E04 report and state table were audited against prior Gate-D/E01-E03 evidence.
- No semantic contradiction was found; the ownership model is coherent.
- The declared JSON model artifact was missing and has now been created.

## E04 VERIFIED RESULTS
- TLMMainApp owns shell coordination state and tab instance refs.
- permission_guard owns normalized permission/plan/limit decisions and the block-notifier service API.
- TLMInfoTab owns server/license/session/heartbeat transport state.
- TLMStartTab owns multi-window HWND/preview/grid/sync runtime state.
- Feature FSM/account/schedule state remains tab-owned.
- Cross-thread block notifications marshal back to Tk with root.after.
- Persistent files remain separate from in-memory app state.
- Exact private permission_guard backing globals and heartbeat mutation order remain explicit UNKNOWN/PARTIAL.

## E05 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Shared config service exposes CONFIG_PATH/CONFIG_DIR/SETTINGS_PATH plus get/load/save/read/write helpers.
- Shared central config path is %APPDATA%/TLMTool/config.ini using RawConfigParser and UTF-8 section/key writes.
- settings.ini safe-read behavior explicitly tolerates duplicate keys with last-wins/no-error semantics.
- settings.ini writes use temp file + os.replace atomic replacement and dated backup/pruning behavior.
- _BACKUP_KEEP exists but its exact numeric value remains UNKNOWN.
- _settings_lock is shared across config-consuming tabs; exact lock class remains UNKNOWN.
- Feature tabs share the [Settings] section but own typed defaults/fallbacks and JSON-in-INI complex values.
- InfoTab has a separate config.ini simple-dict ConfigParser contract and is not silently merged with the central APPDATA config helper.
- Runtime JSON/text state files remain separate from the shared INI service.
- No global filesystem hot-reload watcher was recovered.

## E06 VERIFIED RESULTS
- debug_logger.setup creates the central append-only session log under log/tlmtool.log and tees stdout/stderr to the original streams plus the file.
- Session Start/End markers, runtime/executable information and timestamp formatting are recovered.
- Central log trimming drops oldest content when MAX_SIZE is exceeded and keeps newest KEEP_SIZE content; exact numeric size values remain UNKNOWN.
- Main startup separately enables faulthandler against crash_fault.log.
- A custom threading.excepthook records [THREAD-EXC] metadata plus traceback through the central log path.
- memory diagnostics use separate tlm_memory.log with documented >1MB truncation behavior.
- data/automove_log.txt is monitored by Tối ưu watchdog for per-PID Perf: ping evidence and belongs to the injected/performance diagnostic boundary.
- No explicit central logging lock/queue was recovered; concurrent-write serialization remains NOT RECOVERED.

## E07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Concurrency is split across Tk after/after_cancel jobs, Python worker threads, listener/service threads, and external/native process boundaries.
- Background workers return Tk mutations through root.after rather than touching widgets directly.
- CPU monitor is a daemon worker with bounded join cleanup.
- Start input sync uses a Queue-backed serialized worker plus Locks and daemon listener threads.
- Start preview/cache worker performs window/basic-info refresh around 3s and heavier memory refresh around 8s without Tk calls.
- Login owns cancellation Events and a launch Lock; Party owns cancellation/locks and one-thread-per-group execution with join(timeout).
- Daily/Farm/Train families use per-account threads, stop Events/running-generation flags and main-thread UI apply.
- Emulator remote listener is a daemon ThreadingHTTPServer service with shutdown/server_close.
- Info heartbeat is centrally coordinated through Tk after-id state.
- CreateRemoteThread/helper processes are explicitly separated from Python threading.
- Exact daemon flag for every worker, every join timeout, and simultaneous global stop ordering remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## E08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Normal close is driven by Tk/root/widget destruction plus tab-owned <Destroy> save/stop hooks; no main-shell WM_DELETE_WINDOW callback was recovered.
- Twelve tab/module Destroy hooks were enumerated; exact cross-tab destroy order remains UNKNOWN.
- Forced heartbeat shutdown uses a confirmation/strike model, waits about 5s on the second blocking state, destroys the GUI and uses os._exit.
- Forced heartbeat shutdown explicitly leaves the independent forwarder process running.
- TLMMainApp._rebuild_tab and preview refresh paths are in-process widget/view rebuilds, not process restarts.
- Start-page Reload is an unstick/input-window recovery command via _unstick_all_cmd / unstick_windows, not a TLMTool restart; exact helper micro-sequence remains UNKNOWN.
- Login row Reload advances that forwarder proxy, closes that account's tracked game window if present, then immediately logs the account in with the new proxy.
- Auto-update explicitly confirms, closes all game windows, stops all forwarders, resolves update link, finds/spawns update.exe; external updater replaces files and relaunches TLMTool.
- Normal user-close global forwarder cleanup remains NOT PROVEN/UNKNOWN.

## E09 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Process-level diagnostics use faulthandler plus a custom threading.excepthook with traceback logging.
- Feature workers commonly expose done/error callbacks and restore UI state on the Tk main thread.
- Config load/save/parse failures are locally caught/logged and do not terminate the main GUI; per-key fallback remains feature-owned.
- Server startup/heartbeat validates timeout/status/token/decode results, records failures and reschedules rather than crashing on the first failure.
- Runtime permission_guard is the logic boundary; UI disabled state is only cosmetic. Fail-closed behavior is explicitly documented for sensitive missing/invalid server states, with a special limit<=0 trial/unlimited semantic.
- Synchronous window messaging uses SendMessageTimeout/SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG; Start input retries a short path two times on transient Unity-busy failure then skips that slave/current action.
- Input stale-lock watchdog and idempotent unblock recover missing releases/master changes.
- Emulator remote validates token/action/identity/required fields/config value formats and returns structured ok/error results.
- Exact retry delay, exact HTTP status mapping for every emulator error, and exhaustive source-level try/except tables remain explicit UNKNOWN/NOT_RECOVERED.

## E10 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Start/stop coordination is distributed across TLMMainApp shell state, StartTab quick orchestration and feature-owned FSMs; no universal global feature FSM was recovered.
- Entering Xếp-lưới explicitly stops active Farm/Train plus Daily Trừng Ác and Tàng Bảo Đồ before enabling layout+input sync.
- Switching Auto/manual disables both synchronization systems.
- Start quick commands delegate to feature-tab methods in short threads; feature tabs remain authoritative owners of long-running FSM/workers.
- Farm/Train LSV/Đồn/Daily expose synchronization helpers that mirror authoritative feature state back to Start buttons.
- Farm/Train LSV/Đồn have per-account plus all-account start/stop surfaces; Daily keeps separate Trừng Ác/Tàng Bảo Đồ FSMs.
- Rao/Tối ưu expose _start_all_busy guards; Phó Bản exposes stop-all-run control.
- Runtime permission/account-limit checks remain authoritative at action time.
- Login owns post-login routing; Party waits all groups then executes its configured post-party action once.
- Selected-tab refresh start/stop is UI polling only and is separate from feature execution.
- Universal 'starting one feature stops all others' behavior was NOT recovered and must not be invented.

## GATE E DECISION
- E01–E10 COMPLETE / VERIFIED for static core/lifecycle evidence.
- Explicit unknowns remain localized and move to later feature/runtime parity gates.

## F01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Re-opened the exact user archive and inner TLMTool.exe before using Login screenshot evidence.
- Current Login screenshot hash matches the Gate-B B03 baseline exactly.
- Original EXE resolves all three Login group widgets as Tk LabelFrame using Bold.TLabelframe.
- Game group controls, conditional game-path/captcha-status labels, schedule Checkbutton/readonly Combobox/radio widgets, account Canvas+Scrollbar structure and bottom Bắt đầu button were recovered.
- Exact after-login source labels/internal values are Chờ/wait, Party/party, Train/train, Train LSV/train_lsv, Dồn vàng/don.
- B03 screenshot transcription `Đồn văn` was corrected: source label is `Dồn vàng`; right-edge raster clipping hid/misled the final glyph.
- Header selector is a custom check-glyph Button calling _toggle_all_checks, not an unknown native checkbox.
- Account rows use custom selector Button + account/password Entry + readonly captcha Combobox + Login Button + proxy/reload Button.
- Captcha modes are Không / Tool / Proxy; proxy action is Tool→⇄, Proxy→➜, Không→blank gray disabled.
- Logical account-row capacity is exactly 100. Plan updates may hide/restore rows through _hidden_rows/apply_account_row_limit.
- Locked screenshot geometry remains authoritative: 17 full rows + partial 18th visible in the viewport, row pitch 35 px, bottom Bắt đầu 410×30.
- Hidden/conditional lbl_dll_status, lbl_sched_countdown, lbl_proxifier_status and _profile_btns are not assigned invented pixels.

## F02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Login account rows persist in the shared settings.ini [Settings] / accounts entry.
- Rows are newline-delimited; row fields are pipe-delimited.
- Save-side field order is check, user, pass, captcha, proxy.
- Normalized cache fields are check, username, password, captcha_mode, proxy_env.
- _accounts_cache is the plain-dict persistence model synchronized from widgets before save.
- The model has 100 logical rows; plan-limited rows are preserved in _hidden_rows.
- Autosave is debounced by 300 ms; <Destroy> provides a separate final-save path.
- login_online.json is runtime live-window/session state, not the account list.
- last_login_times.json is separate login-history state.
- Exact serialized check token and exact legacy Có migration mapping remain UNKNOWN.

- Login credential masking is display-only and uses the Entry show option with a one-character star mask.
- The show/hide toggle applies to visible rows and rows preserved in _hidden_rows without changing the underlying Entry text.
- Account cache and persistence carry the credential field directly; no credential encryption/base64/DPAPI/keyring transform was recovered in LoginTab.
- Selected login rows pass the credential forward as mk/mk_val into the original login sequence.
- Username normalization has strip evidence; no separate credential-strip evidence was recovered.
- No explicit credential clipboard path or explicit credential log format was recovered.
- Delimiter escaping for the pipe/newline account format was not recovered.

## F04 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Canonical Login game executable is exactly "Thần Long  Mobile.exe" with two spaces.
- Folder selection uses tkinter.filedialog.askdirectory; user selects a directory, not an EXE.
- _resolve_game_dir returns (resolved_dir | None, note) and documents four recognition cases: selected direct, selected/Game, selected child-inside-Game parent recovery, and one-level child scan prioritizing names containing game.
- Resolver strips trailing slash/backslash and reports nonexistent/not-found outcomes without requiring a hard-coded install root.
- Invalid selection uses messagebox.showerror with title "Thư mục game không hợp lệ" and example D:\ThanLongMobile_PC\Game.
- Success status begins "✅ Đã chọn game thành công:" and reuses/re-packs lbl_game_dir.
- Valid path recognition enables path-dependent _profile_btns.
- game_dir appears in both Login load-config and save-config blocks, so the resolved directory participates in persistent Login configuration.
- _get_exe_path is the launch-facing boundary; Open Game/login/profile paths reject missing directory or missing canonical executable.
- Profile launch receives a common exe_path plus profile_idx 1-5; no separate per-profile game-install directory contract was recovered.
- Exact _get_exe_path revalidation microsequence, immediate config-flush timing, and launcher cwd derivation remain UNKNOWN/deferred.

## F05 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Generic Open Game is guarded by has_permission(login_tab), check_account_limit(login, extra=1), configured game_dir and _get_exe_path.
- _open_game dispatches launch work to daemon _launch_worker rather than blocking Tk.
- Generic launcher uses _make_safe_env, _apply_proxy_hook_env and spawn_and_inject with a recovered 15,000 ms timeout literal.
- _make_safe_env(tlm_profile:str)->dict keeps Windows essentials + TLM_PROFILE and excludes Python/VirtualEnv leakage.
- Login proxy overlay exposes TLM_PROXY_ENABLE/HOST/PORT/FAIL with host 127.0.0.1; exact enable encoding remains F08/UNKNOWN.
- Active launch payload is ./data/resources.dat.
- spawn_and_inject creates the game with CREATE_SUSPENDED, injects LoadLibraryW via VirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory/CreateRemoteThread, waits, then NtResumeProcess, returning (success,pid,error_msg).
- inject_into_pid is a separate existing-process helper with double-inject guard.
- find_main_window_by_pid binds by returned PID, preferring UnityWndClass or title containing Thần Long, then first visible PID-owned window.
- _launch_one_window serializes game opens under _launch_lock, waits up to 25s for the PID-owned HWND and a stabilization phase, then hands off the HWND.
- Multi-account contract is LAUNCH TUẦN TỰ + LOGIN SONG SONG; only the launcher half is completed in F05.
- Forwarder readiness is a launch precondition when used; a dead required port prevents game launch into that network path.
- _login_resize_monitor checks game-window size every second and only resizes when not 1366x768.
- Profile-specific launch indices are 1-5 with busy/success/inject-failure/error states.
- Exact generic profile-iteration policy, cwd derivation, post-HWND stabilization duration, failure-cleanup micro-order and UnityCrashHandler cleanup timing remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## F06 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Checked rows are parsed as (row_idx, tk, mk, captcha_mode, proxy); missing username/password is rejected before normal login.
- Row login is asynchronous through _single_login_worker and uses a retry loop bounded by MAX_LOGIN_RETRIES; exact numeric retry value remains UNKNOWN.
- Login mouse actions use background/window-relative click_at through the DLL sync/PostMessage path, so the physical cursor does not move.
- Username/password text uses press_at with WM_CHAR/Unity activation and does not require user physical keyboard focus.
- Readiness is detected with PrintWindow so covered game windows can still be checked.
- login.login1 + login.login2 must both match; login-form timeout is exactly 100s.
- login.update popup is detected and closed at exact coordinate (630,457).
- Exact credential sequence: username click (613,302) → type tk → password click (573,362) → type mk → Login click (684,506).
- login.vaoTroChoi wait has strong static evidence for a 150-check ceiling, followed by click at (684,450); exact poll delay remains UNKNOWN.
- Step 8 awaits common.active with exact timeout 30s and cancellation/window-validity guards.
- On success the worker calls _mark_row_online and _record_login_time; online runtime state and last-login history are updated through the already recovered stores.
- Failed retry attempts use _force_close_window before another launch/login attempt.
- Multi-account behavior keeps F05 launch serialization but allows login-click workers to run in parallel under Semaphore(MAX_PARALLEL_LOGIN); exact semaphore limit remains UNKNOWN.
- The monitor waits for all login threads before aggregating results and resetting overall Login UI.
- Captcha internals remain F07; proxy policy remains F08; post-login routing remains F10.

## F07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Current per-row captcha modes are exactly Không / Tool / Proxy.
- Runtime mapping is explicit: Không→direct, Tool→ordinary/free-proxy path, Proxy→row-specific private proxy path.
- Tool path uses the proxy/forwarder helpers and exact runtime log DÙNG PROXY FREE; detailed allocation/rotation remains F08.
- Proxy path uses row private proxy and exact log DÙNG PROXY RIÊNG; missing private proxy is rejected/skipped rather than silently falling back to the free pool.
- _on_captcha_mode_change exact contract: Tool→⇄, Proxy→➜, Không→hidden/blank disabled; mode changes schedule account autosave.
- User-selecting Proxy may auto-open the private-proxy popup; loading saved config must not auto-open it.
- Private-proxy editor has a permission guard, 440x100 popup, accepted input-hint formats and parse_proxy validation surface.
- Login initialization calls _check_dll_status; readiness label has red "Vượt captcha chưa hoạt động" and green "Hệ thống vượt captcha sẵn sàng" states.
- _check_dll_hash_worker uses MD5/freshness logic and can show "Đã cập nhật cấu hình mới nhất" or "Cần cập nhật cấu hình".
- No hard readiness-status gate over the captcha Combobox/login worker was recovered; do not invent one.
- No Login-owned external captcha solver/OCR/2captcha/Selenium API surface was recovered.
- Legacy load surface contains proxy_mode none/free/private plus Không/Có/Tool/Proxy tokens. Exact Có migration and legacy proxy_mode mapping remain UNKNOWN.
- General proxy pool/forwarder rotation/pinning mechanics remain explicitly deferred to F08.

## F08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Packaged proxy_working.txt baseline is hash-locked: 131 entries (108 SOCKS5, 17 HTTP, 6 SOCKS4).
- Shared parser contract returns host/port/user/password/protocol and supports explicit SOCKS5/SOCKS4/HTTP plus multiple authenticated/unauthed text forms.
- Login treats proxy_working.txt older than 5 minutes as stale and refreshes it in a worker-thread path.
- proxy_refresh suppresses overlapping refreshes, has a <60s recent-refresh skip guard, downloads/deduplicates/checks proxies in parallel, and writes live proxies fastest-first.
- A real refresh resets every forwarder index to 0 and clears stale advance/allocation state so the new fastest list starts from the beginning.
- Runtime account proxy-advance threshold is 300 seconds / 5 minutes. This is supported by serialized _proxy_reload_threshold=300 and >5/<5-minute call-site logs.
- The original sentence claiming >=30 minutes is stale documentation and is explicitly not treated as runtime truth.
- Multi-account forwarder mapping is port=22200+profile_idx with iid=str(profile_idx); 22200 is reserved for the default instance.
- Multi instances use IID-suffixed mode/index/stats/pid/advance/pinned files.
- Healthy listeners are reused; stale/non-listening or zombie port owners are replaced before game launch; forwarder readiness is required before launch.
- Mode switching is file-driven and does not require restarting a healthy forwarder.
- Private proxy is pinned per IID; pinned failure is PINNED-ONLY with no fallback to the free pool.
- Tool/free mode uses cross-process allocation locking via proxy_alloc.lock/proxy_alloc.txt and a shared proxy_bad.txt failure list.
- Selective routing is critical: GAME SERVER 103.147.34.81 ports 3001/4001 is proxied while CDN/SDK 443 must remain direct.
- _advance_forwarder_proxy uses an advance-file signal plus idx-file confirmation.
- Row reload advances once, closes that row's tracked game session, and immediately re-logins without a second automatic advance.
- forwarder_stats[_IID].json is consumed asynchronously for UI status.
- Exact ALLOC_TTL, BAD_COOLDOWN/PROXY_COOLDOWN numeric values, forwarder ROTATE_INTERVAL and some low-level worker/socket timeouts remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## USER SCOPE LOCK — PROXY
- User explicitly requested on 2026-10-04: **không phát triển phần Proxy**.

- Do not implement/extend/fix runtime proxy/network features or create new proxy behavior unless the user explicitly reopens that scope.

- Proxy-specific runtime work in future Gate Q is skipped/analysis-only.

## F09 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Manual Bắt đầu and the schedule checkbox are explicitly independent control paths.
- Schedule enable starts the worker/countdown without immediately opening games; disable stops the worker/clears countdown and leaves existing game windows untouched.
- _schedule_cancel Event and _schedule_active state own cooperative scheduler lifetime.
- Schedule worker checks due events every 20 seconds; countdown UI is updated on the Tk main thread about every second.
- _next_occurrence uses today if the configured HH:MM is still future, otherwise tomorrow.
- Original EXE contains an explicit fix for the old late-enable bug: missed times are not executed immediately; each event advances by +1 day after triggering.
- Scheduled close logs "Đến giờ tắt game (...) — đóng tất cả" and invokes Login close-all semantics; exact internal close/cancel/tracking micro-order remains UNKNOWN.
- Optional shutdown-after-close shows a topmost 340x150 popup with 60-second countdown; closing/Hủy cancels, confirm/timeout invokes shutdown /s /t 0.
- Scheduled open reuses _open_game_batch and therefore uses the currently checked Login accounts plus the F05/F06 launch/login pipeline.
- If a Login batch is already active when open time arrives, the scheduled open is skipped instead of starting a duplicate batch.
- Scheduler remains active after Login success/failure and continues waiting for the close event.
- schedule_on/schedule_close/schedule_open/shutdown_after_close are persisted Login config fields.
- Automatic worker resume on a completely fresh process solely because saved schedule_on=True remains EXPLICIT UNKNOWN.
- Proxy runtime development remains OUT OF SCOPE under the user scope lock recorded in PLAN.md and STATE.md.

## F10 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Rechecked the current uploaded `TLMTool_2.1.2(4).zip`; its inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` is SHA-256 `15c8044f215680d6851c8f901a5dc7d181068d91a8938f2a628077cf21a2df22`, matching the frozen EXE used by the existing forensic work. Gate A was not repeated.
- Cross-checked the supplied Login screenshot against the EXE before recording UI behavior.
- `Sau khi login` modes are persisted under `after_login`; default/fallback is `wait`.
- Internal mode mapping is: Chờ→wait, Party→party, Train→train, Train LSV→train_lsv, compiled EXE Dồn vàng→don.
- Canonical visible text is `Dồn vàng` / internal `don`. F01/B03 and the frozen EXE agree; the user explicitly reconfirmed `Dồn vàng` during F11.
- `LoginTab._auto_start_after_login` is the generic routing coordinator. Exact original documentation says it waits for the target tab to scan the just-logged windows and then activates that tab's real Bắt đầu path; Chờ does nothing.
- Party has a dedicated helper `_auto_start_party_after_login` using `party_tab_ref`, `_member_rows`, `_running`, and `_toggle_run`.
- Train / Train LSV / Dồn vàng use `farm_tab_ref` / `train_lsv_tab_ref` / `donvang_tab_ref`, scan `_acc_rows`, guard `_farming` / `_farming_acc`, and invoke the real `_toggle_farm`.
- Target tab selection happens before readiness waiting because hidden tabs may not scan while hidden.
- A separate original helper explicitly cross-references `login_tab._wait_and_activate`; F11 resolved the generic wait as 1.0s polling, at most 20 polls / 20s, with `want.issubset(have)` over target `_acc_rows.get("hwnd")` values.
- Generic and Party helpers contain nested main-thread/UI handoff surfaces; final tab/start mutation is not performed blindly from the background wait path.
- Missing tab refs produce warning/skip behavior.
- Already-running target automation is skipped so the toggle is not accidentally inverted/stopped.
- Routing errors are logged locally: tab-switch and auto-start failures do not redefine the completed credential-login result.
- F09 scheduled open and manual Login both reuse `_open_game_batch`; both therefore feed the same post-login routing layer after normal Login completion.
- F11 resolved the generic Login helper HWND readiness predicate/cadence. Exact mixed-success/zero-success routing guard remains runtime-only UNKNOWN.

- docs/login/F10_POST_LOGIN_MODEL.json

## F11 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Re-read PLAN.md and STATE.md; F11 was the only current task and F01–F10 were not redone.
- Current uploaded `TLMTool_2.1.2(4).zip` SHA-256 is `c1d51ffcc2c9f4c8f11c1ae70a90f63eb7c58e06b972ef08e48c71c0517c02cd`, byte-identical to the frozen archive already used by F01/Gate A.
- Inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` remains SHA-256 `15c8044f215680d6851c8f901a5dc7d181068d91a8938f2a628077cf21a2df22`.
- Current Login screenshot `TLMTool_4dw2sgi7mQ(4).png` is SHA-256 `a555bce4054a0d32d19c2377a726c7fa2e6b78c03ce80e8291affb6185f04461`, byte-identical to B03/F01; no UI remeasurement was needed.
- Final canonical label is **Dồn vàng** with internal mode `don`. PLAN.md was corrected from stale `Đồn vàng` occurrences to `Dồn vàng`.
- F11 audited F01–F10 as one Login handoff and found no contradiction requiring earlier task redo.
- New static evidence resolves the generic post-login readiness loop:
  - original same-as-`login_tab._wait_and_activate` helper serializes range constants 0/20/1;
  - `issubset` at frozen EXE file offset about `0x2b808ab`;
  - `sleep` at about `0x2b808b5`;
  - serialized float 1.0 immediately follows;
  - explicit documentation says hidden destination tab must be selected then waited on for at most 20s and reads target `_acc_rows.get("hwnd")`.
- Generic Train / Train LSV / Dồn vàng readiness contract is therefore: select tab → once per second build `have` HWND set → ready when `want.issubset(have)` → maximum 20 polls / 20 seconds → final dispatch on main Tk thread.
- Original login_tab metadata shows `_auto_start_after_login` has no explicit success/results parameter; the completion layer owns success/total aggregation and invokes the routing surface separately.
- Exact branch guard for mixed-success and zero-success batches cannot be proven from the static specimen. It remains a runtime-only parity case, not an invented rule.
- Party remains a dedicated `_member_rows` / `_running` / `_toggle_run` path; its exact instruction-level readiness-set construction remains explicit UNKNOWN.
- Proxy runtime development remains OUT OF SCOPE.
- Login research gate F01–F11 is now closed for research and ready for later Stage-S reconstruction; Stage S is not started early.

- docs/login/F10_POST_LOGIN_MODEL.json (resolved handoff fields only)
- PLAN.md (canonical Dồn vàng wording correction)

## GATE F DECISION
- F01–F11 COMPLETE / VERIFIED for Login static+visual research handoff.
- Generic post-login HWND readiness is locked to 1.0s polling, max 20s, set-subset readiness.
- Mixed-success / zero-success route guard remains runtime-only and is explicitly reserved for later Windows original-vs-reconstruction parity testing.
- Proxy runtime implementation remains excluded by user scope lock.

## G01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Re-read PLAN.md and STATE.md and executed G01 only; no previous Party geometry was remeasured.
- Re-opened the frozen `TLMTool_2.1.2(4).zip` / inner EXE first. Inner `TLMTool.exe` remains SHA-256 `15c8044f215680d6851c8f901a5dc7d181068d91a8938f2a628077cf21a2df22`.
- Party module markers are frozen around `.party_tab`, `party_tab.py`, `<module party_tab>`, and `PartyTab.__init__`.
- Party-owned constructor state surfaces recovered: `_running`, `_cancel`, `_run_lock`, `_run_cancels`, `_targets_lock`, `_refresh_id`, `_refreshing`, `_closing`, `_last_targets`, `_member_rows`, `_sections`, `_sec_team`, `_sec_corps`, plus refs to Phó Bản / Train / Train LSV / Dồn vàng.
- Constructor lifecycle is wired as build UI → load config → bind Destroy cleanup → start refresh.
- Bottom green `Bắt đầu` is a real Party action bound to `_toggle_run`.
- `Sau khi party` is backed by `_after_party` StringVar and exact values: Chờ/wait, Train/train, Train LSV/train_lsv, Dồn vàng/don, Phó bản/phoban. A write trace participates in config persistence.
- `Cấu hình tổ đội` owns the ready-account container `_team_body`.
- `Cấu hình nhóm` is dynamic and parameterized with active team keys `party_groups` / `party_group1`; `+ Thêm nhóm` binds `_add_group_cluster`.
- One group cluster wires: leader label, 6 readonly account Comboboxes (B04 locks 2×3), `Rời nhóm` → `_leave_group`, delete → `_remove_group`, Combobox open → `_open_dropdown`, selection → `_on_group_selected`, group action → `_run_single_cluster`, leader update → `_update_leader_label`, structural renumber → `_renumber_groups`.
- Party refresh consumes shared `start_tab.get_windows`, shared `utils.get_character_info` / `RoleName`, PID/window-identity bind/unbind helpers, and applies worker results back through Tk `after`.
- Party does NOT own DWM preview, layout sync or keyboard/mouse sync. Static scan of the Party module range found no DWM thumbnail, `_toggle_layout`, `_toggle_input`, PostMessage or SendInput ownership. Those remain Start/window-subsystem responsibilities.
- Permission UI wiring recovered through `permission_guard`, `has_permission`, `check_account_limit`, `has_permission_with_limit`, `set_children_state`, `refresh_permission_state`, and `_apply_group_permission`.
- Config uses shared `read_settings` / `write_settings` under `Settings`, with `party_after`, team group JSON, plus compatibility surfaces `party_corps_groups` / `party_corps_group1`.
- Important correction: the old Party module prose mentions `Theo sau đội trưởng` and `Tự nhặt đồ`, and compatibility keys `party_follow` / `party_pick` remain, but the active frozen PartyTab widget/method surface has no matching BooleanVar/widgets/toggle methods. The real matching controls/methods are in PhoBanTab. These two controls must NOT be added to reconstructed Party UI.
- B04 pixel geometry remains unchanged; only its stale static-only note was corrected.
- Detailed HWND enumeration, refresh cadence, stale HWND/process replacement and ready-account identity are deliberately deferred to G02.
- Character-state semantics beyond the shared RoleName surface remain deferred to G03.
- Actual create/invite/run behavior remains deferred to later G action tasks.

- docs/UI_BASELINE_TLM.md (targeted Party baseline correction only)

## G02 VERIFIED RESULTS
- G02 used the frozen original EXE first; B04 geometry was not re-measured.
- Party consumes `start_tab.get_windows()`; no Party-local EnumWindows/IsWindowVisible discovery path was recovered.
- Party refresh uses a daemon worker for cached-window/character reads and a Tk-after apply path for UI/member updates.
- Party recurring refresh is exactly **3000 ms**. Frozen constant bytes `6c b8 17` decode to 3000 with the same small-int encoding already validated in F11.
- Exact first refresh tick timing and exact Tk-after handoff delay remain UNKNOWN.
- Party runtime identity is HWND + PID generation through `_pid_of`, `bind_window_identity`, row `pid`, and `unbind_window_identity`.
- Direct Party log proves same numeric HWND with a new PID is treated as a replaced process generation: old member is removed, identity unbound, widget destroyed, then refreshed.
- `_remove_stale_members(active_hwnds)` removes members whose HWND disappears from the current shared active set.
- Party display name uses shared character info → `RoleName` → `<[^>]+>` sanitization; a `Window ` fallback prefix exists, exact suffix UNKNOWN.
- Ready list relayout is 3 accounts per row and hides members already chosen into groups.
- Group dropdown refresh removes earlier-group selections from later choices while preserving the current value when possible.
- Party owns refresh stop/cancel/destroy surfaces; exact destroy micro-order remains UNKNOWN.
- Character state beyond name/identity is deferred to G03; team action behavior remains later G scope.

## BLOCKERS
None known for G03.

## DO_NOT_TOUCH
- Preserve Gate A forensic baseline unchanged.
- Preserve B04 Party pixel geometry unchanged; G01 only corrected a stale documentation-only control claim.
- Preserve Gate F Login handoff.
- Do not add Party follow/pick checkboxes; those are not active PartyTab UI in this frozen EXE.
- Do not move preview/layout/input-sync ownership into PartyTab.
- Preserve explicit unknowns instead of guessing.
- Proxy runtime/network development remains locked out.
- Do not start Stage S source reconstruction early.

## NEXT_ACTION
On CONTINUE:
1. Read PLAN.md.
2. Read STATE.md.
3. Execute G03 only.
4. Inspect the frozen original EXE first.
5. Recover Party character-state boundaries: fields read from `utils.get_character_info`, display/name identity, RoleID/TeamID sources, invalid/sentinel values, and read-failure behavior.
6. Reuse G02 HWND+PID generation identity; do not redo window discovery.
7. Do not implement team create/invite behavior yet.
8. Cross-check B04 only after static extraction.
9. Persist G03 evidence/report, update STATE.md, and advance only after verification.
