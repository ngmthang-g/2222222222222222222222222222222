## C06 AUDITED / CLOSED RESULTS
- Rechecked the exact user-provided `TLMTool_2.1.2(3).zip`: SHA-256 matches the Gate-A frozen archive, so no forensic baseline was redone.
- Inner `TLMTool.dist/TLMTool.exe` hash matches the binary used by C01–C05.
- Current Xếp-lưới screenshot is byte-identical to the prior Gate-B baseline; UI baseline therefore remains valid.
- Recovered grid config from original binary:
  - `grid_cols` default = 3
  - `grid_rows` default = 4
  - persisted under Start settings.
- `_arrange_grid` recovered with:
  - `GetSystemMetrics`
  - exact literals 450 and 40
  - `min`, `sorted`, `new_slots`, `ww`, `wh`
  - master index 0 / top-left
  - remaining HWNDs sequential after master.
- Exact grid arithmetic formula remains explicit UNKNOWN; no meaning is invented for literals 450/40.
- `_move_windows_offset` is the shared move-only primitive:
  - `pos_fn(index) -> (x,y)`
  - keeps current size
  - master index 0.
- `SetWindowPos` family is recovered; no `MoveWindow` literal/import was recovered from the inner EXE.
- `resize_window` block contains:
  - `GetWindowPlacement`
  - `ShowWindow(SW_SHOWNORMAL)`
  - `SetWindowPos`
  - `SWP_NOZORDER`, `SWP_NOACTIVATE`, `SWP_NOMOVE`.
- Shared stack primitives recovered:
  - tight → (0,0)
  - diagonal → +50 x/+50 y
  - horizontal → +50 x
  - vertical → +50 y.
- Layout sync architecture recovered:
  - `_toggle_layout`
  - `_sync_windows_loop`
  - `_layout_worker`
  - `_arrange_grid`
  - cached HWND list via worker.
- Limit model recovered:
  - server source `new_version_info.max_windows`
  - fallback literal 999
  - worker-cached process count
  - over limit prevents sync
  - `_auto_stop_sync` stops both layout sync and input sync.
- Re-audit confirmed the earlier C06 evidence with no contradictions.
- Exact 1.5s cadence recovered in the same binary belongs to input-sync keepalive, NOT layout-worker cadence.
- Explicit unknowns preserved:
  - exact grid arithmetic / final tile-size expression
  - exact grid +/- bounds
  - exact max-window comparator operator
  - exact layout-worker cadence.
- C07 evidence was observed (Auto 1366x768 reset, RoleName auto-tile, 1-second loop) but deliberately not marked complete.

## CURRENT_TASK
D02 — import relationships.

## C07 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Auto is the default Start mode (mode_var = auto).
- _on_mode_change is the shared mode switch handler.
- Auto/manual disables both layout sync and input sync.
- Auto transition resets game windows to (0,0) 1366×768 before/around the Auto tile cycle.
- Auto tiling uses _auto_tile_windows + _auto_tile_loop.
- Original EXE documents a 1-second re-arrangement cadence while auto_tile_active=True.
- Auto tiling sorts using character-info RoleName and keeps master first.
- Auto tile toggle is wired to _get_max_windows / _count_game_processes.
- Switching to sync/Xếp-lưới stops active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ.
- Exact final Auto tile arithmetic and exact max-limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C08 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp lưới is internal mode value sync and uses _on_mode_change.
- Entering sync automatically enables layout synchronization and mouse/keyboard synchronization.
- Active Train, Trừng ác and Tàng bảo đồ are stopped before entering sync.
- Grid defaults are 3 columns × 4 rows and match the screenshot.
- Dedicated +/- handlers exist for columns and rows; _on_grid_change updates labels and persists config.
- Layout path uses _sync_windows_loop / _layout_worker / worker cache / _arrange_grid with master first.
- Input sync keepalive is explicitly 1.5 seconds.
- Over-limit path disables both layout and input sync.
- Exact grid bounds, layout-worker cadence, grid arithmetic and limit comparator remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C09 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview exposes 1x–5x column choices.
- preview_grid_var default is 2x and matches the screenshot.
- _set_manual_preview_grid is the real manual-grid callback.
- _get_preview_columns parses the x-form selection into preview column count.
- refresh_window_preview_list consumes preview_cols/preview_rows and places items by row/column.
- Current 2x geometry remains 3 items in 2 columns, outer frame 205×137, visible surface 197×110.
- Preview order is separate from column count and is preserved by HWND across rebuild.
- Main preview remains live DWM thumbnails.
- Detached preview uses separate detached_grid state and persists it; no main preview_grid settings key was recovered.
- Exact preview_rows arithmetic/manual-flag timing remain explicit UNKNOWN; other column pixel geometries remain runtime-unverified.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C10 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp gọn is wired to _stack_tight_cmd.
- Exact original behavior: all current game windows move to (0,0).
- Shared _move_windows_offset preserves current size and processes master first.
- Layout movement resets the hidden/off-screen bookkeeping state.
- Shared movement path is SetWindowPos-family, not a resize-to-default operation.
- Exact interaction if the Auto tile loop is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

## C11 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Xếp chéo is wired to _stack_diagonal_cmd.
- Exact positioning rule is origin (0,0) with +50 X/+50 Y per ordered window index.
- Shared engine preserves current size and processes master first.
- Re-layout clears hidden/off-screen bookkeeping.
- Exact interaction if Auto tiling is already active remains explicit concurrency UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C12 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Ẩn hết is a real hide/show toggle using _windows_hidden.
- Hide moves all game windows to (-2200,-2200) and preserves their current size.
- It deliberately avoids SW_HIDE so Unity keeps rendering and PrintWindow/PostMessage background operation remains usable.
- _saved_window_rects + GetWindowRect bookkeeping exists.
- Toggle changes to Hiện hết after hiding.
- Specific restore log/doc says (0,0), while generic toggle doc says old position; exact saved-rect restore use is preserved as a documentation conflict/UNKNOWN.
- Any visible re-layout can clear the hidden bookkeeping through _reset_hidden_state.

## C13 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Đóng xem belongs to the detached-preview control bar and closes preview/view resources, not game windows.
- _close_detached_preview explicitly distinguishes user_initiated=True for the close button.
- Detached view uses real DWM overlay destination windows.
- Refresh is a separate close+reopen path.
- Hủy tách and Đóng xem are distinct visible actions.
- C16 remains the actual game-window Đóng hết task.
- Exact secondary user-initiated state changes and Hủy tách-vs-Đóng xem embedded restoration remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C14 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Tách rời uses _toggle_detached_preview and a real DWM detached-overlay subsystem.
- Detached region is documented as x=0, y=768 to screen bottom, width screen_width-450.
- Detached overlays have topmost behavior.
- detached_auto_open is persisted with fallback True and uses silent no-window opening.
- detached_grid is persisted with recovered default-like value 3.
- Detached control bar includes Cột/Tên/HP/Lv/Map/refresh/Hủy tách/Đóng xem.
- _detached_update_loop rebuilds on game-list changes independently of Start-tab visibility.
- Exact embedded-preview visibility/restoration sequence remains explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C15 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Main preview has a real `Làm mới` control and a dedicated full-list DWM rebuild method.
- Full rebuild clears old preview items, unregisters DWM thumbnails, destroys destination overlay HWNDs/frames, then recreates live DWM previews from the current game-window/cache set.
- Current 1x–5x preview-column selection is reused during rebuild.
- Manual preview ordering is preserved by HWND across refresh/rebuild.
- `_update_window_previews_loop` can also conditionally rebuild the list when `need_refresh` is true and separately refreshes labels/HP.
- Detached ↺ refresh uses `_refresh_detached_preview`: close then reopen to reload the current game-window list.
- Exact Tk command expression for `btn_refresh_preview`, exact `need_refresh` formula, and forced fresh-memory-read semantics remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C16 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview `Đóng hết` is wired to the original close-all callback and shared game-close utility.
- The original utility operates on the current game-window HWND list and sends each live game window a normal Windows close request.
- No force-termination path for the main game executable was recovered in the shared close utility.
- Lingering Unity crash-handler processes are handled by a separate cleanup path.
- This is distinct from `Đóng xem` (preview teardown) and `Làm mới` (preview rebuild).
- Existing discovery/preview maintenance eventually removes stale preview/master state after HWNDs disappear.
- Exact immediate post-click refresh timing remains explicit UNKNOWN; close-specific confirmation behavior was not recovered.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C17 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Preview arrows reorder the embedded preview list.
- Left uses delta -1; right uses delta +1.
- Order state is keyed by source HWND and survives refresh/rebuild.
- Boundary behavior and detached-order propagation remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C18 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ các cửa sổ` is a real toggle backed by `_toggle_layout`.
- Runtime state includes `layout_active`, `sync_layout_running`, `sync_loop_id`, and grid-slot state.
- The maintenance path uses `_sync_windows_loop` → `_layout_worker` → worker-cached HWNDs → `_arrange_grid`.
- Grid application is master-aware: current master is index 0/top-left.
- Xếp-lưới mode auto-enables layout synchronization; Auto/manual disables it.
- Runtime max-window policy is integrated; the over-limit path stops both synchronization subsystems.
- Manual master change auto-disabling layout sync is not proven.
- Exact worker cadence, initial layout-active value, and exact stop/cancel ordering remain explicit UNKNOWN.

- WINDOW_BEHAVIOR_MATRIX.md

## C19 VERIFIED RESULTS
- `Đồng bộ phím chuột` is a real persistent input-synchronization subsystem.
- The selected master window is the event source; other game windows are targets.
- Mouse coordinates are converted to master-client coordinates and scaled to each target client size.
- Click processing is ordered; scroll and mouse-move have dedicated paths, with move throttling.
- Input-sync keepalive is exactly 1.5 seconds.
- Stale target state is released by a watchdog at about 10 seconds.
- Changing master while input sync is active turns input sync off and releases target state.
- Keyboard press/release uses a dedicated synchronization path.
- Exact key-message format, move-throttle interval, listener startup timing and retry delay remain explicit UNKNOWN.

## C20 VERIFIED RESULTS
- The locked original screenshot shows three simultaneously tracked game identities: 75C.S6, TổngTài.S6, ThápCa.
- TổngTài.S6 is selected as master while the preview order starts with 75C.S6, proving master order and preview order are independent.
- Embedded preview uses 2 columns while physical game-window layout independently uses a 3×4 grid setting.
- With three live HWNDs, the combined model is one master source plus two follower targets.
- C01–C19 discovery, identity, DWM preview, ordering, layout, refresh, close, layout-sync and input-sync models are mutually coherent.
- Exact physical grid geometry/timing and a future reconstructed-build Windows three-HWND parity run remain deferred rather than falsely marked PASS.

## GATE C DECISION
- C01–C20 analysis is complete for original static + screenshot evidence.
- Remaining unknowns are explicit and localized.
- Reconstructed executable runtime parity is deferred to the later implementation/parity stage.

## D01 VERIFIED RESULTS
- Frozen inner EXE hash rechecked against Gate A.
- 244 valid exact module markers were recovered from the original EXE.
- 538 unique module-like `.py` filename references were recovered as supplemental provenance.
- 32 physical native `.pyd` modules were inventoried from the frozen distribution.
- Canonical D01 inventory contains 573 rows: 570 accepted unique names + 3 rejected string artifacts.
- Accepted categories: 42 TLM internal, 225 third-party Python, 265 stdlib references, 32 native extensions, 6 Nuitka hooks.
- Confidence is explicit: 276 HIGH, 294 MEDIUM; filename-only references are not overclaimed as executed modules.
- The full row-level inventory is committed as `D01_MODULE_INVENTORY.tsv.gz`; helper EXEs/DLLs/resources are inventoried separately.

## BLOCKERS
None known for D02.

## DO_NOT_TOUCH
- Preserve Gate A forensic baseline unchanged.
- Preserve Gate B visual contract unchanged.
- Preserve C01–C06 explicit unknowns.
- Do not invent the exact C06 grid formula from constants 450/40.
- Do not treat C07 cross-task evidence as full C07 verification until C07 is executed.
- Do not begin C08 before C07 is verified.

## NEXT_ACTION
On CONTINUE / current continuation:
1. Read PLAN.md.
2. Read STATE.md.
3. Execute D02 only.
4. Recover import/dependency relationships among original modules, prioritizing TLM-internal modules.
5. Separate exact/high-confidence relationship evidence from proximity/name-reference heuristics; do not turn string adjacency into fact.
6. Persist D02 graph/evidence/report and update PROJECT_STATUS.md.
7. Advance to D03 only after D02 is verified at the strongest evidence level available.
